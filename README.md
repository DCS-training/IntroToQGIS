# Introduction to Spatial Data in QGIS 

This repository contains the material connected to a workshop developed for CDCS by **Ian Holmes** [Edina](https://edina.ac.uk/) and **Tom Armitage**.
This workshop is an introduction on how to work with spatial data.

Spatial analysis underpins a wide range of research across numerous fields, from tracking the movements of people, to considering the impact of location on certain phenomena, to studying environmental change.

The workshop covers some of the issues that surround the data and then gets to grips with viewing and styling it using the GIS Software.

Below you can find a repository containing the material connected to this workshop (datasets, a workbook, a deck of slides, and some additional resources).


## How to use this repository
